# Professor Frisby

### Test suite for [Professor Frisby's Mostly Adequate Guide to Functional Programming](https://github.com/MostlyAdequate/mostly-adequate-guide)

As a test-first developer working through this material I threw the tests together as I went through with mocha and chai.

Run with:

    npm install
    npm test

It might be helpful to use this test framework instead of the one that comes with the book if you want to just see a
single solution at a time instead of spoilers for all the solutions for a chapter (at least I wanted that ;).

Sometimes my solutions vary slightly from those of the author, but the book's exercises are tightly written, leaving
few options but what he's looking for.

Enjoy!
